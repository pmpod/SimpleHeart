\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Abstract class for cell implementation. Contains electrophysiology model (C\+E\+M) \& local geometrical properties \hyperlink{class_oscillator}{Oscillator} class is an abstract cell class, in which an electrophysiological model for the cell is implemented. The knowledge about the type of cell electrophysiology model is not relevant to other parts of the program and is encapsulated in the concrete impementation of the model. Any implementation of C\+E\+M should inherit from this calss. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
